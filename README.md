# Jet-Engine-Performance-Simulator
Hi everyone. The Jet Engine Performance Simulator is a python based  application to analyze the various jet engines types. The basic flight parameters are taken as user input and then the programme generates the end results of net thrust , overall efficiency, exhaust velocity , etc.  I have also used Tkinter and Matplotlib in this programme.
